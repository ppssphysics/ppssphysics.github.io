        <font size="3">The product features a very brief analysis of a publically available data set presenting the results of a global survey conducted in 2016 by the <a href="https://www.globalshapers.org/fr">Global Shapers Community</a>, with the objective of strengthening the voice of youth across the world. This Community is a self-managed network of decentralized Hubs across more than 130 countries. The community was born 5 years ago as an initiative of the World Economic Forum and is powered today by more than 6000 young people from ages 20 to 29.</font>

        <font size="3">Through this dasboard, you can explore the results of the survey. More than 26000 young people aged from 18 to 35 answered the survey which was articulated around two leading questions: What do young people think about the world anbd what do they want to do about it? You can find out more about the survey and download the raw data here (<a href="shaperssurvey.org">shaperssurvey.org</a>)</font>
